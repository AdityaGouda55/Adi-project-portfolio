<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
    Don Quixote started his quest 415 years ago, and people still talk about him.  Today, I'm like Don Quixote and have done what no one else has done.  I've assembled a list of the best paragraphs ever.


My list is limited to paragraphs from books written more than a few years ago because it’s not legal to show other authors’ works without their permission, even when I give them credit.


Also, I haven’t included the first paragraph of any novel because this has been done by other sites.  I assume you’re interested in writing stories with more than one paragraph.


Without revealing too much about them, I’ll point out that each, to me, is a short story unto itself.  Each conjures pages of images and thoughts in my mind, making me want to read them repeatedly.
